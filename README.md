# Adventure_Work_DataEngineering_Project
## Project Review
It is an End-to-End Data Engineering project from scratch where I leverage powerful technologies like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark.It includes data ingestion, transformation, serving, and reporting, following the medallion architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers).
### The Architecture
1. **Data Source**
     - Source: External APIs via HTTP connections
     - Mechanism: Pull data using API calls (e.g., using Python, Azure Functions, or Logic Apps)
2. **Data Ingestion**
     - Tool: Azure Data Factory
     - Description: A low-code/no-code orchestration tool that is powerful and flexible.
     - Key Feature: We use **dynamic pipelines** with parameters and loops for scalable ingestion.
3. **Medallion Architecture**
     ðŸ”¹ Raw Data Store (Bronze Layer)
         - After pulling the data, it's landed in the Bronze layer, also known as the Raw layer.
         - This is an exact copy of the source data, stored as-is for auditing and reprocessing purposes.
     ðŸ”¸ Transformation Layer (Silver Layer)
         - Tool: Databricks
         - Description: Databricks handles the bulk of the transformation and cleaning process using PySpark.
         - We extract data from the Bronze layer, apply transformations, and push clean data to the Silver layer.
     ðŸŸ¡ Serving Layer (Gold Layer)
         - After transformation, the cleaned and enriched data is served to stakeholders.
         - Example consumers: Data Analysts, Data Scientists
         - Common target: Data Warehouse built using Azure Synapse Analytics
4. **Reporting**
     - The final step involves building interactive dashboards using Power BI.
     - We connect Power BI to Azure Synapse or other data stores, pulling relevant fact and dimension tables for analysis
