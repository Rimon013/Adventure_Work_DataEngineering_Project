###Project Review
It is an End-to-End Data Engineering project from scratch where I leverage powerful technologies like Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake, Databricks, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Apache Spark.This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data engineering solution using Azure services. It includes data ingestion, transformation, serving, and reporting, following the medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold layers).
